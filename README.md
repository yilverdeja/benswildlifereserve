A bootstrap website designed in Figma for an add-on to the [Meatify "web-app"](https://github.com/yilverdeja/meatify).

Check out the [Background Video](https://youtu.be/GHAydCyG2O8) on the home page which contains ambient music in the background.

## Story
After hearing the Meatify idea, we imagined a chicken slaughterhouse that's under the guise of a wildlife reservation. The target audience are Meatify customers since Meatify always suggests to eat Chicken Breasts in the result page.

## Disclaimer
No chickens were harmed in the making of this website.
